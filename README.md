## Project Overview

AbstracX is a comprehensive web application designed to facilitate competitive programming and coding challenges. Key features include:

- Creation and management of programming problems with customizable test cases
- Submission and evaluation of solutions in multiple programming languages
- Real-time disqualification, re-evaluation, and code review functionality
- Intuitive web interface for an optimal user experience

The project aims to provide a robust platform for coding enthusiasts, students, and professionals to hone their programming skills, participate in competitive events, and showcase their abilities.

## Architecture and Design

AbstracX follows a client-server architecture, with a JavaScript-based frontend and a PHP/Python-powered backend. The system is designed with a focus on modularity, extensibility, and security. This allows for the easy addition of new programming languages, problem types, and features as the project evolves.

## Technologies Used

The AbstracX project was developed using the following key technologies:

- **Backend**: PHP, Python
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Continuous Integration**: GitHub Actions

## Installation and Configuration

To set up the AbstracX development environment, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Nexeum/AbstracX.git
```

2. Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd Judge
```

3. Start the server

```bash
  python3 judge.py -judge
```

## Project Structure

The AbstracX project follows a modular structure, with the following key components:

- `sys/`: Contains the PHP application code, including controllers, models, and views.
- `judge.py`: Contains the Python  application code, including APIs, services, and data models.
- `assets/`: Holds the frontend assets, such as HTML templates, CSS, and JavaScript files.

This structure allows for a clear separation of concerns and facilitates the expansion of the project as new features and functionalities are added.
